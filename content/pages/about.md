# About This Blog

This blog is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a blazingly fast static site generator written in Rust, and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It uses the [tabi](https://github.com/welpo/tabi) theme for a modern, clean look with perfect Lighthouse scores and built-in dark mode support.
